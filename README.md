# Array Manipulation

## Overview
In this lab, I have built a small shopping list app using JavaScript arrays.
It allowed adding, removing, and filtering items in a list.
I used bootstrap for the basic layout and custom CSS for styling.
I have used google for the syntax and bootstrap for help to get the spooky style.

## Learning
- I have learned how to create a array
- I have added a functions to
           1. Add a new item
           2. Remove the last item
           3. Search and filter items
- I have rendered the list dynamically on a webpage using DOM methods

## Reflection Questions
1. How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?
- push() made it esy to add new items to the array, and filter() helped me find matching items quickly without writing loops.
2. What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?
- It didnot work properly because of the case sensitive. I fixed it by converting everything to lowercase before comparing.
3. How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?
- I would add local storage so the list stays even after refreshing the page, and maybe add I would have add a "Remove Selected item" instead of removing the last item.
