# Array Manipulation

## Overview
In this lab, I have built a small shopping list app using JavaScript arrays.
It allowed adding, removing, and filtering items in a list.
I used bootstrap for the basic layout and custom CSS for styling.
I have used google for the syntax and bootstrap for help to get the spooky style.

## Learning
- I have learned how to create a array
- I have added a functions to
           1. Add a new item
           2. Remove the last item
           3. Search and filter items
- I have rendered the list dynamically on a webpage using DOM methods

## Reflection Questions
1. How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?
- push() made it esy to add new items to the array, and filter() helped me find matching items quickly without writing loops.
